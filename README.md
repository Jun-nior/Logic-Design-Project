# Logic-Design-Project
Overview
This repository houses the innovative project of an autonomous robot with Mecanum wheels, capable of self-navigation on roads and recognizing traffic signs through integrated AI-powered image recognition. It leverages the power of a Teachable Machine-created model and the versatility of an ESP32 Camera module. A bespoke GUI application is included to provide manual control over the robot as an alternative operating mode.
