# Autonomous Mecanum-Wheeled Robot with AI Image Recognition
## Overview
This repository houses the innovative project of an autonomous robot with Mecanum wheels, capable of self-navigation on roads and recognizing traffic signs through integrated AI-powered image recognition. It leverages the power of a Teachable Machine-created model and the versatility of an ESP32 Camera module. A bespoke GUI application is included to provide manual control over the robot as an alternative operating mode.
## Features
- Autonomous Navigation: The robot is designed to navigate independently, utilizing an array of sensors and programmed logic to move fluidly in any direction, thanks to the Mecanum wheels' unique omnidirectional capabilities.
- AI-Enhanced Sign Recognition: Using a convolutional neural network model created with Google's Teachable Machine, the robot can identify and respond to various road signs, enhancing its interaction with the environment.
- ESP32 Camera Integration: The on-board ESP32 Camera module captures real-time video, serving as the robot's eyes for both autonomous navigation and sign recognition tasks.
- Manual Control GUI: An intuitive graphical user interface allows users to manually direct the robot's movement and monitor AI prediction results, providing a seamless interactive experience.
